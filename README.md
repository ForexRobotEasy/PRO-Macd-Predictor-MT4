# Pro Macd Predictor MT4

This code is an implementation of the Pro Macd Predictor MT4 expert advisor. The expert advisor calculates the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator and uses it to make predictions about the market.

## How it works

The code consists of several functions and a main trading logic. Here is a breakdown of each part:

### CalculateMACD function

This function calculates the MACD line, signal line, and histogram. It uses the CopyBuffer function to retrieve the MACD values and the IndicatorCreate and IndicatorSetDouble functions to calculate the signal line. The MACD line and signal line values are then used to calculate the histogram.

### PredictMACDCrossing function

This function predicts the MACD line crossing by taking the current MACD value, the previous MACD value, and a rate of change parameter. It calculates the prediction by adding the difference between the current and previous MACD values multiplied by the rate of change to the current MACD value.

### PredictTrendShifting function

This function predicts the trend shifting by taking the current MACD value, the previous MACD value, and a rate of change parameter. It calculates the prediction by subtracting the difference between the current and previous MACD values multiplied by the rate of change from the current MACD value.

### StudyTimeframes function

This function is a placeholder for implementing logic to study different timeframes. It can be used to analyze market data from multiple timeframes and make predictions based on the analysis.

### CalculateDistance function

This function calculates the distance between the MACD Predictor line and the last price. It takes the MACD Predictor line value, the last price, and a scaling factor as parameters. It calculates the distance by subtracting the last price from the MACD Predictor line value and multiplying it by the scaling factor.

### AnalyzeMarketPressures function

This function is a placeholder for implementing logic to analyze market pressures. It can be used to analyze market data, such as volume or price action, and make predictions based on the analysis.

### OnInit function

This function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It sets the short name of the expert advisor to 'PRO Macd Predictor MT4'.

### OnDeinit function

This function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It can be used to clean up and perform any necessary deinitialization logic.

### OnTick function

This function is called on every tick. It calculates the MACD, predicts MACD line crossings and trend shifting, studies different timeframes, calculates the distance between the MACD Predictor line and the last price, analyzes market pressures, and places trading logic based on the predictions and analysis.
